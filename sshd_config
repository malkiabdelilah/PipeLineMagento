# Anti-DoS
#
# Random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three 
# colon separated values “start:rate:full” (e.g. "10:30:60").
# sshd(8) will refuse connection attempts with a probability
# of “rate/100” (30%) if there are currently “start” (10)
# unauthenticated connections. The probability increases
# linearly and all connection attempts are refused if the
# number of unauthenticated connections reaches “full” (60).
MaxStartups 10:30:60

# Log sftp level file access (read/write/etc.) that would 
# not be easily logged otherwise
